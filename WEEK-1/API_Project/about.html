            <h2>Pokemon Types</h2>
            <p>Pokemon are fun and exciting creatures that come in many different types, helping us understand how they battle and interact with each other. There are 19 types, such as Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, and more! Each type has unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, Fire-type Pokémon are strong against Grass-type Pokémon but weak against Water-type Pokémon. Some Pokémon can even have two types, which makes them even more interesting! Understanding these types helps trainers choose the best Pokémon for battles and makes the game more enjoyable.</p>
